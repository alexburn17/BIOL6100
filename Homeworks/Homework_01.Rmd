The goal of this first exercise is to make sure that all of your software is installed properly and working.

Make sure everything is set up and working on the laptop that you will be using for this course. 

Specifically, you should have the most current versions of R and Python/miniconda, and Positron installed. You should make sure that you can now run R and python code in Positron. You will also make a github account. 


The TA will make a brief presentation and step you through a series of checks to make sure you are ready to go on all of these things.

Due by the end of lab:    

* The link to your github account: `https://github.com/YourUserName`
* Show your TA that you can run the following R code when the R interpreter is selected:

```
x <- 3 + 2
print(x)
```

...and this Python code when the python interpreter is selected. 
```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
