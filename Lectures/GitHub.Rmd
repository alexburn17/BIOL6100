## Learning git and GitHub

* multiple copies of files
* access to past copies
* originally developed for teams of coders interacting on a single project
* learn how to use for your own work
* use for building portfolio and maintaining webpage
* use in tandem with a project in Positron, but can be used with any files

### Basic Vocabulary

* `Version Control` A system for maintaining current and past copies of all of your files and a record of all the changes you have made;
* `git` Version control software for tracking your project on your local computer
* `GitHub` A free, public remote website where your project is permanently hosted
* `Repository` Any collection of files that belong to the same project, plus a few special `git` files that set up the version control. Also called a `repo` by hipster programmers.
* `Clone` Create a local copy of a repository from the GitHub website to your own computer.
* `Commit (the noun)` A snapshot of your file system at a particular time.
* `Commit (the verb)` Taking a snapshot of your files at the current time with a short message describing changes.
* `Push` Copying committed changes from your local repository up to GitHub.
* `Pull (= fetch)` Copying the current state of the repository on GitHub down to your local machine.

# Creating a webpage hosted by GitHub using Positron and Quarto

> These instructions mirror the traditional RStudio + `.Rmd` workflow, but use **Positron** and **Quarto (`.qmd`)**.

---

## REQUIRED: Install Quarto system-wide (macOS, Windows, Linux)

Quarto **must** be installed system-wide so it works in Positron, the Terminal, and GitHub Pages.

### macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)

1. Go to [https://quarto.org/download/](https://quarto.org/download/)
2. Download the **macOS `.pkg` installer**
3. Run the installer and accept the defaults
4. Restart **Terminal** (important)

Verify:

```bash
quarto --version
```

If you see `zsh: command not found: quarto`, Quarto is **not** installed correctly.

---

### Windows (Required)

1. Go to [https://quarto.org/download/](https://quarto.org/download/)
2. Download the **Windows `.msi` installer**
3. Double-click the installer and follow the prompts
4. **Restart your computer** after installation

### Verify on Windows

Open **PowerShell** (recommended) or **Command Prompt** and run:

```powershell
quarto --version
```

You must see a version number. If you see an error such as:

```
'quarto' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

then Quarto is not on your system PATH and must be reinstalled.

---

### Linux

Download the appropriate package from [https://quarto.org/download/](https://quarto.org/download/):

* `.deb` for Debian / Ubuntu
* `.rpm` for Fedora / Red Hat

After installation, verify:

```bash
quarto --version
```

---

## Ensure Positron uses the system-wide Quarto installation

If Positron was installed before Quarto, it may still use a bundled copy.

### Check which Quarto Positron is using

In the **Positron Terminal**, run:

```bash
which quarto
```

If you see:

```
/Applications/Positron.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto
```

Positron is using its internal Quarto and must be fixed.

### Explicitly set the Quarto path in Positron

1. Open **Positron → Settings**
2. Search for **Quarto**
3. Set **Quarto: Path** to:

Intel Macs:

```
/usr/local/bin/quarto
```

Apple Silicon Macs:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin/quarto
```

4. Restart Positron

Re-check:

```bash
which quarto
```

---

## Create the new project

* In Positron: **File → New Project → New Directory → Quarto Website Project**
* Choose a project name (this will become your GitHub repository name)
* Finish setup and open the new project
* In the Terminal, run pwd to check the current directory

---

## Add git functionality to the new project

* Open the Terminal
* Initialize git:

```bash
git init
```

---

## Link your local repository to GitHub

This step involves **both your local Positron environment and the GitHub website**.

### Step 1 — Create a repository on GitHub (Web Interface)

* Go to GitHub and log in
* Click **New Repository**
* Use the **same name** as your local project
* Set visibility to **Public**
* Select the options to initialize with a README, `.gitignore`, and license.

### Step 2 — Connect your local repository to GitHub (Positron Terminal)

* Open the **Terminal pane in Positron**
* Run the following commands, replacing `USERNAME` and `REPO` with your GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Explanation:**

* `git remote add origin` tells your local repository where the GitHub repository is
* `git branch -M main` renames your local default branch to `main` (if not already named)
* `git push -u origin main` pushes your current branch to GitHub and sets it to track the remote branch

---

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting: `src refspec main does not match any`

If you see this error:

```
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs
```

it means **there are no commits yet**, so the `main` branch does not exist.

#### Fix (Most Common Case)

1. Make an initial commit **before** pushing:

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

2. Now push again:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

This should succeed.

---

#### Check which branch you are on

If the error persists, run:

```bash
git branch
```

If you see `master` instead of `main`, push with:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

You can rename it later if needed.

---

## Clean up the new project

* Edit `.gitignore`
* Open the file in the directory and add:

```
*.pdf
*.docx
```
This will ensure that PDFs and .doc files are not added to the repository. This can
Be useful for other large file types like images and videos.

---

## Commit changes to the new project

If you haven't already, make your first commit. 

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m 'initial project setup'
git push
```

---

# Build and host a website

## Create the homepage

* Open `index.qmd`
* Edit the title and content
* Render using **Render** (Mac: cmd-shift-k - PC: ctrl-shift-k) or...

```bash
quarto render
```

---

## Commit webpage changes

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m 'add website'
git push
```

---

## Host the website with GitHub Pages

* Go to repository → **Settings → Pages**
* Source: Deploy from a branch
* Branch: `/main`
* Click Save

Your site will be live at:

```
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/
```

# Basic git workflow from the terminal

## Before starting work

* `git status`
* `git pull`

## Make changes

* Edit `.qmd` files
* Render to HTML

## Stage changes

* `git add -A`

## Commit

* `git commit -m 'describe change'`

## Push

* `git push`

---

# Summary of workflow

* `status`
* `pull`
* edit / render
* `add`
* `commit`
* `push`
